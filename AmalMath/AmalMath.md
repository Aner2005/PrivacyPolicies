AmalMath app does not collect any information about the user - the results for correct\incorrect answers given by the user are stored locally only. 

This app currently does not request any permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file (will possibly require Internet in future updates if Ads are included).

At the moment, the app does **not** contain Ads and does **not** have inapp purchase options (this might change in future updates).

Please note that altough the app itself does not collect any information, statistics about app crashes, downloads, updates, removals, etc. might still be collected\processed (i.e., not by the app).

If you have any question, please send me an email to Aner_2005@hotmail.com or post a discussion on GitHub.
